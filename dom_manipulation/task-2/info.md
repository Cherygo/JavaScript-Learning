# Magic Mouse

## Requirements

- Custom cursor should follow the actual mouse position and be centered
- Cursor should expand based on the element that it hovers over
- You should be able to set/define the elements that should trigger the expand behavior

Note the default cursor is hidden via CSS.

You can edit the HTML based on your discretion.
